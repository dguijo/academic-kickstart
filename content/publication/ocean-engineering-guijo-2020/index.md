abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to tackle simultaneously short- and
  long-term energy flux prediction (specifically, at 6h, 12h, 24h and 48h time horizons).
  The methodology proposed is based on the Multi-Task Learning paradigm in order to
  solve the four problems with a single model. We consider Multi-Task Evolutionary
  Artificial Neural Networks (MTEANN) with four outputs, one for each time prediction
  horizon. For this purpose, three buoys located at the Gulf of Alaska are considered.
  Measurements collected by these buoys are used to obtain the target values of energy
  flux, whereas, only reanalysis data are used as input values, allowing the applicability
  to other locations. The performance of three different basis functions (Sigmoidal
  Unit, Radial Basis Function and Product Unit) are compared against some popular
  stateof-the-art approaches such as Extreme Learning Machines and Support Vector
  Regressors. The results show that MTEANN methodology using Sigmoidal Units in the
  hidden layer and a linear output achieves the best performance. In this way, the
  multi-task methodology is an excellent and lower-complexity approach for energy
  flux prediction at both short- and long-term prediction time horizons. Furthermore,
  the results also confirm that reanalysis data is enough for describing well the
  problem tackled.
