abstract: 'This paper evaluates the performance of different evolutionary neural network
  models in a problem of solar radiation prediction at Toledo, Spain. The prediction
  problem has been tackled exclusively from satellite-based measurements and variables,
  which avoids the use of data from ground stations or atmospheric soundings. Specifically,
  three types of neural computation approaches are considered: neural networks with
  sigmoid-based neurons, radial basis function units and product units. In all cases
  these neural computation algorithms are trained by means of evolutionary algorithms,
  leading to robust and accurate models for solar radiation prediction. The results
  obtained in the solar radiation estimation at the radiometric station of Toledo
  show an excellent performance of evolutionary neural networks tested. The structure
  sigmoid unit-product unit with evolutionary training has been shown as the best
  model among all tested in this paper, able to obtain an extremely accurate prediction
  of the solar radiation from satellite images data, and outperforming all other evolutionary
  neural networks tested, and alternative Machine Learning approaches such as Support
  Vector Regressors or Extreme Learning Machines.'
