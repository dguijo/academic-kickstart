abstract: "In the last decade, the sound quality of electric induction motors\
  \ is a hot topic in the research field. Specially, due to its high number of applications,\
  \ the population is exposed to physical and psychological discomfort caused by the\
  \ noise emission. Therefore, it is necessary to minimise its psychological impact\
  \ on the population. In this way, the main goal of this work is to evaluate the\
  \ use of multitask artificial neural networks as a modelling technique for simultaneously\
  \ predicting psychoacoustic parameters of induction motors. Several inputs are used,\
  \ such as, the electrical magnitudes of the motor power signal and the number of\
  \ poles, instead of separating the noise of the electric motor from the environmental\
  \ noise. Two different kind of artificial neural networks are proposed to evaluate\
  \ the acoustic quality of induction motors, by using the equivalent sound pressure,\
  \ the loudness, the roughness and the sharpness as outputs. Concretely, two different\
  \ topologies have been considered: simple models and more complex models. The former\
  \ are more interpretable, while the later lead to higher accuracy at the cost of\
  \ hiding the cause-effect relationship. Focusing on the simple interpretable models,\
  \ product unit neural networks achieved the best results: 38.77 for MSE and 13.11\
  \ for SEP. The main benefit of this product unit model is its simplicity, since\
  \ only 10 inputs variables are used, outlining the effective transfer mechanism\
  \ of multitask artificial neural networks to extract common features of multiple\
  \ tasks. Finally, a deep analysis of the acoustic quality of induction motors in\
  \ done using the best product unit neural networks."
