abstract: 'Purpose of review: Machine Learning techniques play an important role in
  organ transplantation. Analysing the main tasks for which they are being applied,
  together with the advantages and disadvantages of their use, can be of crucial interest
  for clinical practitioners. Recent findings: In the last 10 years, there has been
  an explosion of interest in the application of ML techniques to organ transplantation.
  Several approaches have been proposed in the literature aiming to find universal
  models by considering multicenter cohorts or from different countries. Moreover,
  recently, deep learning has also been applied demonstrating a notable ability when
  dealing with a vast amount of information. Summary: Organ transplantation can benefit
  from ML in such a way to improve the current procedures for donor-recipient matching
  or to improve standard scores. However, a correct preprocessing is needed to provide
  consistent and high quality databases for ML algorithms, aiming to robust and fair
  approaches to support expert decision-making systems.'
