abstract: The prediction of convective clouds formation is a very important problem
  in different areas such as agriculture, natural hazards prevention or transport-related
  facilities, among others. In this paper we evaluate the capacity of different types
  of evolutionary artificial neural networks to predict the formation of convective
  clouds, tackling the problem as a classification task. We use data from Madrid-Barajas
  airport, including variables and indices derived from the Madrid-Barajas airport
  radiosonde station. As objective variable, we use the cloud information contained
  in the METAR and SPECI meteorological reports from the same airport and we consider
  a prediction time-horizon of 12 hours. The performance of different types of evolutionary
  artificial neural networks has been discussed and analysed, including three types
  of basis functions (Sigmoidal Unit, Product Unit and Radial Basis Function), and
  two types of models, a mono-objective evolutionary algorithm with two objective
  functions and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm optimised by the two objective
  functions simultaneously. We show that some of the developed neuro-evolutionary
  models obtain high quality solutions to this problem, due to its high unbalance
  characteristic.
